## a python implementation of the "where and when" EM follow-up optimization strategy

The waw python module implements the electromagnetic follow-up optimization strategy described in Salafia et al. 2017 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170405851S). When using this code (including derivative versions) in your own work, please included a proper citation to that article.


## Getting started
Clone this repository, then clone the "aftab" repository (https://github.com/omsharansalafia/aftab) into the *waw* subdirectory.
You can then launch the example script "28840_opt_followup.py" in the *examples* directory to check that everything works fine (make sure you have the prerequisites - see below).

## Prerequisites
The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
